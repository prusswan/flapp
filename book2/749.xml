		It begins to drizzle with rain. Strolling along, you see seven worried shepherds wading about in the middle of a stream waving their crooks in the air. Their dogs are watching in amazement from the banks. ‘Whatever are you doing?’ you ask.
	</p>
	<p>
		‘We’ve decided to herd fish instead of sheep, because you can’t sell mutton on Friday,’ replies one.
	</p>
	<p>
		‘But now it’s raining, we’re trying to round the fish up so they don’t get wet,’ puts in another.
	</p>
	<p>Shaking your head, you set off down the road. <goto section="265"/>.</p>
