	Conflass is a delightful town of white-fronted houses with
	brightly painted timber frames. The burghers of the town are
	open and friendly. As one explains to you: ‘We tell the baronies
	that we pay tax to the Sokarans, and the Sokarans that we pay
	tax to Castle Ravayne. So they both leave us alone. That’s why
	you’ll never find a long face in Conflass.’
