		You come across a goblin crouched on a toadstool. It is chewing a dead rat.
	</p>
	<p>
		The blood dribbles down its chin as it looks at you, grins and says: ‘She works hard to fill her larder. Her mother dined after killing father.’
	</p>
	<p>‘What’s that?’</p>
	<p>
		The goblin gobbles up the last bit of the rat. ‘Answer that riddle, and you’ll know the safe door to take in the old fort on the coast.’
