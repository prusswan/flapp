	A <b>severed head</b> lies on top of a tree stump. Its eyes are open and, moving closer, you are given a nasty shock when it suddenly speaks: ‘I have a favour to ask. Would you take me to the hut of the hermit Knocklar? He’s always taking me out with him when he goes to cut wood and then leaving me behind.’ Having said its piece, the <item name="severed head"/> falls silent and closes its eyes. Add it to your list of possessions if you wish, then <goto section="116"/>.
