	<p>‘I hope this won’t spoil your appetite,’ you say to the bogle.</p>
	<p>He squints at you. ‘Spoil my appetite for what?’</p>
	<p>
		‘For those seven lovely plump milkmaids I saw coming along the path a bit behind me.’
	</p>
	<p>
		He licks his lips. Either that or he’s halfway through eating a giant eel. ‘Mmmm, I love milkmaids,’ he says. ‘Very tasty. But you’re right that I couldn’t manage seven of them after eating you. Decent of you to tell me.’
	</p>
	<p>
		‘No problems. I’ll just wait over here, and you can eat me later.’
	</p>
	<p>
		A sudden glint of suspicion appears in his beady little eyes but by that time you are running away for all you’re worth. It’s a good job that bogles are so stupid. <goto section="153"/>.
