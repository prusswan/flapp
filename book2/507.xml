		You watch the elves of the Forsaken Forest come slinking out of the shadows. Their faces are narrow and vulpine, their bodies slim as saplings. A few are wrapped in rich furs. The others go naked.
	</p>
	<p>
		They sit and eat, but their revelry is muted. Every now and then, one of them will look around suspiciously and murmur: ‘But I could swear the air has a mortal smell...’
	</p>
	<p>
		Eventually they melt away into the woods again. You take the opportunity to pilfer a jug of <item name="faery mead"/> from their banqueting table before heading back down the path. <goto section="22"/>.
