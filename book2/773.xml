		You pass a poor old tramp who has no trousers. ‘I hung them on a branch yesterday while I saw to a call of nature,’ he says. ‘But some rascal made off with them.’
	</p>
	<p>
		The following morning you see seven fools watering a tree by the side of the road. ‘It’s a clothing tree,’ they explain. ‘We got some trousers off it a couple of days ago, and now we’re watering it to see if we can get a coat and hat as well.’
	</p>
	<p>‘You preposterous oafs,’ is all you can say.</p>
	<p>
		As you continue along the road, you hear one of them say: ‘Here, aren’t we supposed to fill the watering can first?’
