		To renounce the worship of the Three Fortunes, you must pay 25 Shards to the priesthood by way of compensation. The priestess begs you to think again. ‘Those who worship the fateful trinity will surely prosper,’ she maintains. ‘But those who turn their back on the goddesses will soon meet them in their own guise - the dreadful weird sisters who preside at every man’s deathbed.’
