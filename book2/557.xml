		A squirrel comes scampering up to you. It watches you with large luminous eyes, head cocked quizzically. Then, to your great surprise, it speaks: ‘My lords and ladies of the wildwood crave a boon. Your presence chafes them. Your aura is the cause of discomfort. The odour of violets is one they cannot abide.’

		You reach into the tree trunk. There is indeed a pot of <item name="faery mead"/>. You take it and, not wishing to incur the elves’ displeasure, return along the path without delay. <goto section="22"/>.
