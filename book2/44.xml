	Sir Debrumas, the seneschal, takes you in to the baroness’s court.
	She sits in regal splendour on the gilded seat of House Ravayne.
	A gonfalon showing the black lion crest hangs on the wall
	behind her. Although young and slender, she has the fierce
	unflinching gaze of one who is born to rule. ‘Why have you
	come?’ she asks.
