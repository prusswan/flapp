		You mention your eerie experience on the cobblestone highway near Castle Ravayne. The abbot seems sceptical. ‘I am not sure that the spirits of the dead can truly speak to the living. Perhaps you dreamed the entire episode.’

		‘If so, it is a remarkable coincidence,’ chips in one of the monks. ‘A man wearing a velvet eyepatch passed through here a while ago. He said that a lucky stroke of fate had saved him from the gallows.’
	</p>
	<p>‘Where was he bound?’ you ask.</p>
	<p>‘East. To Caran Baru in Sokara, I think.’</p>
