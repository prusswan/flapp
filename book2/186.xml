Going on, he reached a camp where slim young gypsy maidens were dancing around a fire. With smiles and merry laughs, they invited the woodcutter to join them. Now it so happened that the woodcutter’s grandmother had been a gypsy, and she’d taught him the traditional greeting that he now called out: ‘Dza devlesa!’ which is to say, ‘May the gods be with you!’ No sooner had the maidens heard this than they all collapsed like matchwood and, creeping closer, the woodcutter saw that there were just piles of mouldering bones in the clearing, and not living people at all.
