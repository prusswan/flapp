<section name="245">
	You come to a road running north-south. A wandering
	entertainer stands nearby changing the wheel of his cart. He tells
	you that the road runs between Wheatfields and Metriciens.
	‘Both cities are dens of traducers, venifers, and sundry other
	callid rascals,’ he says resentfully. ‘I advise you to shun them,
	those edacious fustilugs in their gaudy baudekins!’
