	You are travelling cross-country in eastern Golnir, in the rolling
	hills that sweep down towards the broad river valley of the
	Grimm. A horse trader tells you that the town of Goldfall is
	close at hand. ‘See this scar on my forehead?’ he says, pulling off
	his straw hat. ‘A nugget fell from the sky and brained me, so it
	did! But a villain made off with my nugget while I lay stretched
	out senseless on the grass.’
