<section name="645">
	You come across an old bogle laughing to himself. His body
	looks like a mossy old tree-stump and he has a mouth as wide as
	a sack of coal. When you ask why he’s laughing, he replies:
	‘Because there you are gawping instead of running away, and
	now I’m about to up and eat you.’
