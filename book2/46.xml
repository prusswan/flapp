		‘When I was alive, I kept my treasure safe in a tower built of adamantine stone,’ the corpse tells you. ‘The tower had an impregnable door that could only be unlocked by a key made of star metal. But my death-sleep has been troubled by disquieting dreams. What if a living man should find the key and plunder my hoard?’
	</p>
	<p>
		‘And what is it you want of me?’ you find yourself asking, your voice sounding hollow in the stillness of the crypt.
	</p>
	<p>
		The corpse points past you, out to the south. ‘Go and find the key of stars. Bring it back to me. Then I shall permit you to take a reward.’ As you leave, you hear its parting words: ‘But take care not to return empty-handed, for then my vengeance would be swift and terrible.’
