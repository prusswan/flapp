		‘I only seek to perform my allotted task, for am I not the Sentinel of the Empire?’ it moans, suddenly contrite under your divinely inspired gaze.
	</p>
	<p>

	</p>
	<p>

	</p>
	<p>
		Amid the debris you find an old banner, emblazoned with a golden sun, and a green gem worth 100 Shards. <tick codeword="Dispel"/> and note the <item name="banner of the Shadar"/>, and <gain shards="100"/> on your Adventure Sheet.
	</p>
	<p>You go back the way you came. <goto section="92"/>.</p>
