		You come to a dead end. In the flickering light, which reflects off the frosty walls in a kaleidoscope of blue flashes, you see a panel of ice blocking your way. You hammer at it, but it will not break.
	</p>
	<p>There is a cough behind you.</p>
	<p>
		Wheeling round, you come face to face with a huge, heavyset miner, his face hidden by a blue-hooded cloak. At least you think it’s a miner - his feet are bare, and they are covered in thick black hair.
	</p>
	<p>It growls in a guttural voice, ‘Long time since...’</p>
	<p>‘Since what?’</p>
	<p>
		‘Long, long time. I not see a manthing for long time. I used to dig for them. Smash the ice!’ The creature chuckles and hefts a heavy pickaxe in its hands. ‘They loved old Blue Cap, they did. Yes. Good worker, they said.’
