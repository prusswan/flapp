		The high priestess greets you. You explain how you found the mirror of the Sun Goddess at great risk to yourself, but that you lost it after a terrible calamity befell you. But she doesn’t seem bothered.

		‘Indeed, though you say you lost it, Nisoderu chose to guide it back to us. A woman from the south, called Lauria, returned it to us. I’m afraid she has already collected the reward. And we have nothing left to give - after all, we have only your word that you ever saw it, let alone recovered it.’
	</p>
	<p>You leave, somewhat disgruntled. <goto section="58"/>.</p>
