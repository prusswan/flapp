		The captain’s first mate recognizes you, but you have no idea who he is. He is amazed you don’t know him.
	</p>
	<p>
		‘Don’t you recognize your old friend Clarny Dukes,’ he whines, distraught. ‘You saved my life, when we were lost in the Desert of Bones. Don’t you remember?’
	</p>
	<p>
		You remember nothing. It must have happened during a period of your life of which you have no memory whatsoever. At any rate, you pretend to remember, and the first mate persuades the captain to let you live.

		They put you ashore at their next port of call. <random dice="1"/>.
