		The doors are opened by the butler, Kevar. His long white hair is even longer now. Kaschuf himself, tall, strong, and as bald as ever steps forward.
	</p>
	<p>
		‘Haven’t I seen you somewhere before? No matter, I’ll carve you to pieces, just like all the others!’
	</p>
	<p>
		Kaschuf goes white with terror when you tell him that you have released his soul from a locket you found on an uncharted island.
	</p>
	<p>
		Kevar hops from foot to foot in glee and croaks, ‘Kaschuf is no longer Deathless! He can be killed - he can be killed!’
	</p>
	<p>
		‘The fight’s not over yet, old man,’ bellows Kaschuf, as he glares savagely at you. ‘I could still win!’ Kevar freezes and claps his hand over his mouth.
	</p>
	<p>You must fight.</p>
