		You have entered a long, low hall of a dark grey stone. Riches abound. Crates filled with objets d’art, bolts of silk from Akatsurai, jars of oleum oil from the Feathered Lands, ingots of gold and silver, chests of gems and coins - the treasure house of one of the richest merchants in the world.

		‘Well,’ says Luroc, ‘it’s just a question of how much we can carry, and get away with, isn’t it?’
	</p>
	<p>
		But then you notice him eyeing you oddly, distrustfully, as if unsure of your intent. Come to think of it, you don’t trust him an inch. It might be better to kill him and take everything for yourself - after all, it’s only what he’s bound to try to do to you. Every passing second seems to make you more uneasy, more certain that you’ll have to kill Luroc.
