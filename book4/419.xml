		The <i>Sea Centaur</i> draws alongside. On the poop deck, you see Avar Hordeth, dressed for battle.
	</p>
	<p>
		He spots you, and points you out to his men. ‘I knew it! There’s the thieving devil who stitched me up! Get them, men!’ he orders.
	</p>
	<p>
		His marines throw grappling hooks with experienced efficiency, and soon your two ships are locked in a struggle to the death. Marines and sailors swarm aboard, and a desperate fight ensues.
	</p>
	<p>
		During the confused melee, you come face to face with Avar Hordeth himself. He is wearing armour, and wields a two-handed axe.
	</p>
	<p>
		‘I’ve been dreaming of this,’ he says through gritted teeth. ‘And now I’ll take my revenge by splitting your skull with my axe!’
	</p>
	<p>You’ll have to fight him.</p>
