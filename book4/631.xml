		You find a poor shipwrecked sailor, clinging to a piece of driftwood. Unfortunately, he has expired - still holding on even in death. It seems he was once a captain. You find his log, the last entry of which reads: ‘We set sail today with a good wind behind us. I am worried, however, that we couldn’t afford to buy a blessing from the temple of Alvir and Valmir.’
