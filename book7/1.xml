		The white, shining serpent comes in your dreams. It slithers
		through the dark sky as if on land and then, noticing you,
		descends. It draws nearer and nearer, and it is immense.

		At last you are well enough to leave. Cellacqtella, your
		taciturn healer, walks with you along the edge of the Lake of
		Firewater for three hours, until you can see the city of
		Dunpala in the distance. ‘We part ways here,’ she tells you.
		‘Take these.’ With that, she gives you a small pouch
		containing 20 Shards, and a well-balanced fishing spear
		(COMBAT +1). Note them on your Adventure Sheet.
	</p>
	<p>
		You start to thank her for all that she’s done, but she says,
		‘Thank me by never returning to my home. In this land, it is dangerous to help a foreigner. Goodbye.’
	</p>
	<p>
		You watch her for a time as she walks back the way you
		have come. Then you turn away, and enter Dunpala.
