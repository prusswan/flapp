<section name="Teofilo" profession="Priest">
	<p>
		Teofilo was known as 'the Brutal', 'the Slaver', 'He Who Steals
		Lives'. A vision in Uttaku's House of the Oracle, changed him.
		He saw a weeping mother in a deserted jungle village, and a
		ravenous winged serpent whose face became his own. Teofilo
		freed his slaves and gave away his riches that day. His voyage
		to Ankon-Konu is one of penance and, he hopes, redemption.
