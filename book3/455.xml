		The tavern is a shambles. Several of your men lie dead in the wreckage. The first mate staggers over and you are horrified to see that one of his eyes has been gouged out in the fighting.
	</p>
	<p>‘Yeah, but you should see the other bloke,’ he quips gamely.</p>

		You have the chance to gain a Rank now. You need to
		<random dice="1" var="roll">roll higher</random>
		than your current Rank on one die to do so.
		<if var="roll" greaterthan="r">
			If you do
			<gain ability="rank" amount="1">go up a Rank</gain>,
			permanently
			<gain ability="stamina" amount="1d">
				increase your Stamina by 1-6 points
			</gain>
			(the score of one die) and remember that your Defence score will increase by 1.
