		Somehow you manage to keep your head above water. You swim until your limbs feel as though they are caught in a net. You struggle on, mortally weak but determined not to give up.
	</p>
	<p>
		A ship heaves into view. You raise your arm and give a feeble cry. By some miracle you are spotted, and the ship steers towards you. You are hauled aboard, wrapped in blankets, and given a bowl of hot soup.
	</p>
	<p>
