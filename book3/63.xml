		Several books agree that mermaids can be individually charming, but when encountered in large numbers should be regarded as a grave threat.

		‘The collective noun is a Threnody of Mermaids,’ asserts one source, ‘and few who hear their song can resist its dread allure. According to popular belief, a troubadour who learned the song used it to cause all the inhabitants of Gutrein, a town in Old Harkuna, to abandon their homes and follow him. The town remains empty to this day.’

		The book goes on to say that mermaids are most frequently encountered to the south of the Ruby River estuary.
