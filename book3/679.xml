		The Master of the College has you in for a sherry. Waving you to a deep leather armchair that makes a serious bid at engorging you, he scans your exam papers and says: ‘You seem unsure about anything at all. Most of the metaphysical questions you’ve just answered with a Don’t Know. The sprite liked you so much that it’s taken up residence in your coat pocket - and your smile, instead of curdling the milk, almost froze it.’
	</p>
	<p>You look at him uncertainly. ‘Does that mean–?’</p>
	<p>
		He grins and seizes your hand. ‘You’ll be a model student! Welcome to the college.’
