		The examiners are thirteen astoundingly old men in dusty black robes. They sit at a long table studying the results of your first exam. Minutes tick by, then you hear a low snoring sound.
	</p>
	<p>
		The senior mage raps his knuckles on the table, gathers some papers, and peers down at you.
	</p>
	<p>
		‘We can’t admit you to the college,’ he wheezes. ‘You’re just too insufferably sanctimonious. You need to have an open mind to study wizardry, you know.’
	</p>
	<p>
		You start to leave, but then another of the wizards says: ‘Wait. We can’t have you going straight off to bother another college.’
	</p>
	<p>
		He casts a spell of transportation and you are flung magically across a thousand leagues in the blink of an eye, landing in a dungheap outside the town of Smogmaw. <goto section="44"/>.
