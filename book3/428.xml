		The first mate rushes into your cabin one day toward dusk. Deep in calculation over your charts, you barely glance up when he blurts out: ‘Captain, an ancient hulk has drifted alongside.’
	</p>
	<p>‘She’s adrift, you say? A derelict?’</p>
	<p>
		‘No derelict,’ he replies in an agitated voice, ‘She has a skeleton crew!’
	</p>
	<p>
		‘Hmm.’ You sit back, folding your arms behind you head. ‘Perhaps her skipper wants to flesh out his crew with some of our men...’
	</p>
	<p>
		‘I think you’re right!’ cries the mate, staring past you with wild eyes.
	</p>
	<p>
		Something is tapping on the window pane - something that has terrified the mate. You turn to see what it is. A host of ivory faces are leering in through the casement window. It is a skeleton crew indeed! Crashing through the glass, the bony sailors leap among you chittering in ghastly glee.
