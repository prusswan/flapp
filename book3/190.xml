		Ringed about with desolate shores, the sea keeps up its eternal whisperings. It puts the mate, who is normally an irascible redfaced drunkard, in wistful mood. ‘Often when at home,’ he says, ‘tiring of laughter and song, I take myself to a deserted bay and listen for the sea-nymphs’ flutes that herald the tide.’
	</p>
	<p>‘You’re a poet!’ says the navigator admiringly.</p>
	<p>
