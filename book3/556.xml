		One of the crew is revealed as a woman who disguised herself in order to sign aboard. Her deception only comes to light because she is about to give birth. ‘I thought he - er, she - was getting rather tubby,’ says the ship’s surgeon.
	</p>
	<p>‘Can you deliver the child?’ you ask him.</p>
	<p>‘You’re joking. I can barely set a splint.’</p>
	<p>
		There is nothing for it. You must set a course for the Island of Fire, a volcanic isle which is the nearest place where you might find a competent midwife. Thankfully you reach it before the woman goes into labour. The islanders give you a friendly welcome and their chief’s wives take the woman to their hut.
