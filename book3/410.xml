		The captain rewards you with the contents of his hold:
		<buy cargo="metals" quantity="2" shards="0">
			2 Cargo Units of metals
		</buy>.
		Note these on your Ship’s Manifest, assuming you have the space to load them aboard. (You can jettison your current cargo to make room, if you wish.)
	</p>
	<p>‘What will you do now?’ you ask the captain.</p>
	<p>
		He gives a quick bray of exhausted laughter. ‘Get my ship into port, sell her, and use the money to buy a tavern. I’ll never put to sea again, that’s for sure.’
