		Among the shambling miners you notice one face - your former helmsman, Gaspar Savaloy. His cheeks, once ruddy and welllarded as any yeoman of Golnir, are now hollow; his formerly ample belly has been lost along with memories of good meals.
	</p>
	<p>‘Mister Savaloy,’ you say. ‘Here’s a pretty pass, eh?’</p>
	<p>
		It takes a few seconds for recognition to strike. ‘Skipper! If it ain’t me old skipper what I unjustly abandoned on that isle.’ He starts to sway his head, eyes too parched for tears. ‘Help yer old helmsman, skipper.’
	</p>
	<p>
		You discover from the mine supervisor that it will cost 30 Shards to pay off Savaloy’s indenture.
