		You bump into somebody in the mist - a tall gentleman in a velvet cape. ‘Excuse me.’ You go to move past him; you don’t want Lauria to get away.
	</p>
	<p>
		He plants a thin hand on your chest. ‘A moment of your time. I think we are old acquaintances?’
	</p>
	<p>You shake your head. ‘I don’t believe so.’</p>
	<p>
		‘No? In that case,’ he asks with a twitch of his thin lips, ‘why did you make yourself at home in my house?’
	</p>
	<p>You give him a closer look. ‘Who?’</p>
	<p>
		‘I am Talanexor the Fireweaver, you scoundrel. And your name, I believe, is Lauria.’
	</p>
	<p>
		You start to protest. ‘I’m not Lauria! She’s just gone that way. If we hurry we can catch her.’
	</p>
	<p>
		He gives a hollow laugh. ‘You must think me a fool. Prepare to take your punishment.’
