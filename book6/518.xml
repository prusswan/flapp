	<p>
		‘What do those characters mean that are written along the side?’ you ask him.
	</p>
	<p>‘They spell out the name of the ship: <i>Hell Spawn</i>.’</p>

		You examine this and many other ships. Choose from the types listed below.

		Record the details of your ship on the Ship’s Manifest; you can name her if you wish. Remember to cross off the cost from the money recorded on your Adventure Sheet. The crew quality is average. Each time you arrive at a new destination, remember to change the entry in the Docked column. Currently, of course, the ship is docked at Chambara.
