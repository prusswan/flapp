		You get up in the night feeling thirsty. Stumbling out to the stream behind the cottage, you catch sight of a scraggly creature with luminous grey flesh and red eyes loping down the path from the clifftop.
	</p>
	<p>
		‘Take this stranger!’ cries out a voice from behind you. ‘Just leave our daughter’s body untouched!’
	</p>
	<p>
		It is the old man and his wife. They invited you to stay overnight so that the ghoul would devour you rather than the corpse of their daughter.
