	<p>You sink into a trance in which voices roar and blur.</p>
	<p>‘The assassin is dead, my lord.’</p>
	<p>‘Good. Throw the body into the sea.’</p>
	<p>
		You are stripped of all your possessions and money
		(<lose item="*" shards="*">cross them off</lose>
		your Adventure Sheet) and then flung off the cliffs.
		When the current has carried you up on to a stretch of shoreline safely out of sight of the villa, you cancel the trance spell.
