		Takakura mentions that Kokoro loved to play the flute - especially one tune called ‘The Vague Moon after the Rain’. This is enough for you to go on. You wander the outskirts of the city until the rain lets up and the full moon is unveiled. Then you hear the plaintive sound of a flute and, following it to its source, you find a small cottage with a green door.
