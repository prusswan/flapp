		A monk comes to wake you. You are lying on a prayer mat in front of the effigy of the Sage of Peace. The silvery glimmer of departing night filters into the incense-filled haze.
	</p>
	<p>
		‘What is happening?’ you ask, confused. ‘I can’t remember leaving the catacombs.’
	</p>
	<p>‘You failed the tests,’ replies the monk. ‘Come with me.’</p>
