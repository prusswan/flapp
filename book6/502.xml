		‘But I was undone by pride,’ he says sorrowfully. ‘I came to the Sovereign’s notice because of my musical skill, you see. One day I was asked to play a very ancient flute that had been handed down through the generations. Alas, I did not think to examine it before I started to play. It was full of dust because it had not been played for so long, and so I was reduced to a coughing fit. Unable to bear the shame, I retired from court and came to live out here in the countryside.’
