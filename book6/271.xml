		‘Your majesty, I meant only that I would be ashamed to display my meagre ability in the presence of a true master.’
	</p>
	<p>
		‘A true master?’ Takakura is intrigued. ‘Whoever can you be referring to?’
	</p>
	<p>
		The sick look on Masayori’s face shows that he can see what’s coming, but it is too late for him to slip away. ‘Lord Masayori taught me all I know,’ you announce for everyone to hear.
	</p>
	<p>
		Takakura turns with a smile to the trembling Masayori. ‘Aha, my esteemed Secretary of the Left! So it is you who we sometimes hear playing so melodiously in the middle of the night. Take the flute and entertain us now, then.’
	</p>
	<p>
		There is no way to back out. Masayori takes the flute from you with a distraught look and plays it as best he can. The Sovereign is not fooled. He knows now that Masayori was trying to embarrass you in front of the whole court. You later hear that he has been dismissed from his post and sent to be governor of Oni Province.
