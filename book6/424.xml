		It is a long steep climb. The sun is sinking towards the horizon as you emerge from the trees and look along the clifftop. The late afternoon light is the colour of blood.
	</p>
	<p>
		Lord Kiyomori and his guards stand in a circle around a man who is kneeling with his hands tied behind him. The breeze whips his long loose hair around his face as he looks up at them with a scowl of almost demonic ferocity.
	</p>
	<p>
		‘So, Akugenda,’ says Kiyomori, ‘you are unrepentant even now.’
	</p>
	<p>
		The man called Akugenda spits on the ground. ‘Repentance, you pious hypocrite? I call upon the Thunder Spirit to hear this vow: I’ll be revenged on the pack of you!’
	</p>
	<p>
		Kiyomori looks away in distaste. ‘Enough of this. Jiro, kill him.’
