		An object resembling a giant paper lantern comes drifting over the fields. Intermittently it gives off a gleam of fiery yellow light. As it descends you can make out a man in wizard’s robes standing in a basket slung underneath the lantern, conjuring gouts of flame that he sends shooting up inside it.

	<p>The strange craft bumps to a landing on a nearby hillock.</p>

		‘Hallo,’ calls the occupant of the basket. ‘Want a lift anywhere?’
