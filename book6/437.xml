		The inn is run by a young widow who has several small children. She charges only
		<rest stamina="1" shards="1">1 Shard a day</rest>,
		though you might like to give her a little more if you’re feeling charitable. Each day you spend at the inn allows you to recover 1 lost Stamina point, up to the maximum set by your normal Stamina score when unwounded.
