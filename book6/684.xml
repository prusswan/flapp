		One of the Akatsurese sailors, a man named Narakami, fancies himself as something of a poet. Gazing out to sea he says: ‘Under the wide sky, a scintillant refulgence: the lightning’s flicker. I see it and am fearful, then it fades and I am sad.’
	</p>
	<p>
		‘Belay that talk of lightning,’ shouts the mate superstitiously, ‘or you’ll see me with my lash, and that’ll make you sad all right!’
