		Masayori, Secretary of the Council of the Left, comes out to greet you as you cross the lawn.
	</p>
	<p>‘Ah, you are here at last,’ he says.</p>
	<p>‘Was I expected?’ you retort in surprise.</p>
	<p>
		Masayori puts a flute into your hands. ‘This is the famous flute Twilight Mourner. It is a priceless heirloom handed down by the Sovereign’s ancestors. The Sovereign is waiting at this very moment for you to play to him.’
	</p>
	<p>
		You are hurried through to the inner apartments, where Takakura sits impatiently on a raised dais surrounded by courtiers.
	</p>
	<p>
		‘Ah!’ he says brightly as he sees you enter. ‘Masayori has spoken of your great talent which, if not for him, would have remained forever hidden by modesty. Come, give us a tune.’
	</p>
	<p>Everyone is waiting. What will you do?</p>
