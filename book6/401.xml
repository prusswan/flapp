	<p>‘Who was it?’ one of the pallbearers asks.</p>
	<p>
		‘Just a vagabond,’ replies another. ‘They found the body in this very barn. Died of exposure. Apparently old Kitsuno owns the land hereabouts, so he got lumbered with the funeral costs.’
	</p>
	<p>‘Poor chap. Still, he can afford it.’</p>
	<p>
		The lid of the coffin is open. You sneak a peek and then wish you hadn’t. It is not a pleasant experience to see your own dead body.
