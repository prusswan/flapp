		He tells a story about a poor knight whose wife became inexplicably ill. He roamed far and wide searching for a cure and finally encountered an old hermit who told him that he should search for a dragon, because all dragons have a magical pearl in the roof of their mouth. The hermit claimed that such a pearl was the only thing that could heal the knight’s wife.

		Eventually, after many adventures, the knight encountered the dragon and slew it. He then discovered that the hermit had been the dragon in human form. It had cursed the knight’s wife because of an old feud with her family. After the dragon’ s death the curse was lifted, the wife recovered, and they lived happily ever after on the fortune they got for selling the magic pearl.
