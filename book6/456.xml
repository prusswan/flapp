		The guards were expecting you to back off and make a run for it, so when you run further into the villa it takes them unawares. They chase you through to the courtyard at the back. ‘We’ve got you cornered now!’ shouts one. ‘There’s no way out!’
	</p>

		At the back of the courtyard stands a plain building of unpainted wood with a moss-lined roof. Only the large bronze bell gives any clue to its function. Rushing inside, you come across a statue that gazes down at you with a look of great serenity.

		A man in priest’s robes looks up from his prayers. ‘Who dares invade the temple of the Sage of Peace?’ he says sternly.

		The guards are right behind you. Unless you can think of an escape route, this is where you must make your stand.
