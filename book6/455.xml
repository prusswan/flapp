		You meet an actor who wishes to return to the town where he was born, to see his aged mother. ‘But I have not had much success in my chosen profession,’ he explains. ‘If my mother sees me in these poor rags she will die a disappointed woman. I don’t want her last thoughts to be full of worry for my future.’
	</p>
	<p>
		He offers to sell you his only possession, a finely made dragon mask. He will not sell for less than 100 Shards, and obviously would not normally even go as low as that.
