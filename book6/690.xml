		It is characteristic of the people of Hagashin that they do not bother with the usual distinction between temples to the Sage of Peace and shrines to the divine powers. ‘All creation is divine,’ says a priest, ‘so heaven and earth are one.’

			You can get a blessing for
			<lose shards="35" price="x"/>
		</if>
		<else>
			- or just
			<lose shards="20" price="x"/>
			if you’re an initiate of the Sage of Peace.
		</else>
		Blessings are available for
		<tick blessing="charisma" flag="x"/>,
		<tick blessing="scouting" flag="x"/>,
		<tick blessing="combat" flag="x"/> and
		<tick blessing="magic" flag="x"/>.
		Simply pay the money and note the appropriate ability in the Blessings box on your Adventure Sheet. The blessing works by allowing you to try again when you fail a roll for that ability. You can only use the blessing once; it is then used up and you should cross it off. Also, you can only have one blessing for each ability at any one time.
