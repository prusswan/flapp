		A few locals are discussing recent events - it seems some hideous beast has made its lair in a cave on the hill that overlooks the village.
	</p>
	<p>
		‘It’s a gorlock,’ says a farmer. ‘And it’s amassed quite a bit of treasure by all accounts - lifted from its victims. A brave adventurer like yourself could get rich if you killed it. You’d be doing us a favour as well.’
	</p>
	<p>You ask what a gorlock looks like, but no one knows.</p>
	<p>‘Nobody’s come back to tell the tale!’ says the innkeeper.</p>
	<p>You leave the tavern. <goto section="510"/>.</p>
