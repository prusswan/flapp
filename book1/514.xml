		To renounce the worship of Tyrnai, you must pay 50 Shards to the warrior priests, and suffer the ‘Wrathful Blow’. A priest will strike you once - it is better to be struck by a priest than by Tyrnai himself!

				If you are determined to renounce your initiate status,

				from the God box on your Adventure Sheet. The high priest smashes you across the jaw, saying ‘I’m doing you a favour - believe me!’ Lose 1 Stamina point. If you earlier arranged a resurrection here, it is cancelled with no refund.
