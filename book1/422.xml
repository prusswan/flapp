		The bandits are dead. The man in the suit surrenders. It is Fourze, the master of the market. He terrified people with the monster disguise, and used a large pair of bellows full of gas to put his victims to sleep. Then he sold them to a slaver from Caran Baru, for work in the slave mines. You find Haylie, and several other villagers in the cellar of an old farm nearby.

	<p>
		‘Don’t hurt me,’ begs Fourze, ‘I’m only trying to make a few Shards!’
	</p>
	<p>
		‘What! By selling your own people into slavery!’ says one of the villagers, giving him a good kick.

	<p>You lead them back to Venefax. <goto section="414"/>.</p>
