		A swaggering Sokaran captain marches on board with a complement of marines.
	</p>
	<p>‘I don’t think you’ve paid your harbour duties,’ he says.</p>
	<p>
		‘Harbour duties! We’re in the middle of the sea!’ you exclaim angrily.
	</p>
	<p>
		The captain smiles smugly at you. ‘You’d better cough up 50 Shards, or I’ll impound your ship and its cargo.’
	</p>
	<p>
		‘But that’s no better than common piracy!’ says your first mate, outraged.
	</p>
	<p>
		‘The duty will be 60 Shards now, for calling a captain in the Sokaran Imperial Navy a pirate!’ he sneers.
	</p>
	<p>Several of his men burst into laughter.</p>
