		When you and your crew join the fray, the battle is short-lived. The Sokarans are overpowered, and taken as slaves by the pirates.
	</p>
	<p>
		The pirate captain, Verin Crookback, is a short, bull-chested man. He walks like a hunchback, because of a crippling wound he took to the shoulder blade, many years ago. He thanks you for your help and rewards you with a share of the booty of the Sokaran war ships - only <gain shards="50"/>. He also hands you a <item name="silver medallion"/>.
	</p>
	<p>
		‘If you ever go to the Kingdom o’ the Reavers,’ he says, ‘flash this about - one of the lads’ll recognize it. Villains, the lot of them, but they’ll honour one who carries the medallion. Someone will bring you to me - I’ll help you, if you need it.’
	</p>
	<p>
		The pirates take their leave, and you sail on. <goto section="420"/>.
