		‘Well, well, well, what have we here, friends?’ asks the old man. He seems to be talking to someone next to him, although you are certain he is alone. ‘Looks like a washed up adventurer to me!’ he says in answer to his own question, ‘all wet and out of luck.’
	</p>
	<p>
		He carries on having a conversation - a conversation that quickly turns into a heated debate. He is clearly quite mad.
	</p>
	<p>
		‘Excuse me, umm, EXCUSE ME!,’ you shout above the hubbub in an attempt to grab the old man’s attention. He stops and stares at you.
	</p>
	<p>‘Is this the Isle of the Druids?’ you ask impatiently.</p>
	<p>
		‘Indeed it is,’ says the old man, ‘I see that you are from a far land, so it is up to me to welcome you to Harkuna. But I think you may have much to do here as it is written in the stars that someone like you would come. Your destiny awaits you! Follow me, young adventurer.’
	</p>
	<p>
		The old man turns smartly about and begins walking up a path towards some hills. You can just see some sort of monolithic stone structure atop one of them.
	</p>
	<p>
		‘Come on, come on, I’ll show you the Gates of the World,’ the old man babbles.
