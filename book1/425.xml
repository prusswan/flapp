		The woman tells you her name is Lauria. She leads you stealthily through winding cobblestoned streets to a town house standing at the back of a small tree-lined square.
	</p>
	<p>
		A yellowish fog is descending with the coming of night. Lauria waits until it is thick enough to shroud your activities from any stray passersby, then jemmies a downstairs window. Within seconds the two of you are inside.
	</p>
	<p>
		‘You’ve got the easy job,’ she says. ‘Stay down here and keep watch. The stuff we’re after is upstairs.’
	</p>
	<p>She bounds silently up to the next floor.</p>
