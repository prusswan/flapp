		To renounce the worship of Tyrnai, you must pay 50 Shards to the warrior priests, and suffer the Ceremony of the Wrathful Blow. A priest will strike you once - it is better to be struck by a priest than by Tyrnai himself!

				If you are determined to renounce your initiate status,
				<group>
					<text>pay the 50 Shards</text>
					<tick god=""/>
					<lose stamina="1"/>
				</group>, delete Tyrnai from the God box on your Adventure Sheet. The High Priest smashes you across the jaw, saying ‘I’m doing you a favour - believe me!’ Lose 1 Stamina point. If you earlier arranged a resurrection here, it is cancelled with no refund.
