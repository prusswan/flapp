		You row out into the lake, spread the net, and wait to see what happens.

		After an hour or so, a great bubbling and frothing of the lake disturbs your solitude. A massive scaly head, the size of your boat, erupts out of the ochre-coloured water on the end of a long, sinuous neck. Great luminous green eyes look down at you. The creature is covered in brown scales, with a bright red crest running from the head down its thick, ropy neck.
