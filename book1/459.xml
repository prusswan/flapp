	</p>
	<p>‘Who are you, then?’ it pipes in a squeaky voice.</p>
	<p>
		Just then, a palanquin, carried by four bearers, arrives. A man leans out and hails you, ‘You there! I’ve come to buy that flying monkey but I see I am too late. Nevertheless, I will give you 75 Shards for it.’
	</p>
	<p>
		‘Don’t sell me to that popinjay - free me instead,’ chitters the Mannekyn.
