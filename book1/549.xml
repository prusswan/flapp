		The priestess, dressed in a cloak made entirely of the leaves of trees, with her face smeared with moss, greets you. ‘A tusk!’ she exclaims. ‘But I have no need of another.’
	</p>
	<p>
		You ask if she might need it for the next time. ‘Next time? Mmm, maybe you have a point.’
	</p>
	<p>
		She offers you 15 Shards. If you accept,
		<group>
			<text>cross off the <b>boar’s tusk</b></text>
			<tick shards="15"/>
			<lose item="boar's tusk"/>
		</group>. Either way, when you leave, <goto section="195"/>.
