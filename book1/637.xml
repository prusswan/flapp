		Somehow you manage to evade the creature’s jaws, and swim back to shore. Hauling yourself up on to the beach, you are assaulted by an angry villager.
	</p>
	<p>
		‘Where’s my boat?’ he cries, ‘You’ve sunk it, haven’t you? You city types don’t know a thing! Well, you’ll have to pay me back - fifty Shards at least!’
	</p>
	<p>
		‘Hah!’ you reply, ‘The cost of hiring it was more than its worth in any case. As far as I’m concerned, that boat was mine to do with as I liked!’
	</p>
	<p>
		The argument goes on all the way back to the village but eventually the fisherman gives up and storms off.
