		The high priest tells you that the <b>golden net</b> of the twin gods has been stolen. The repulsive ones have taken it to their palace beneath the sea in the Sunken City of Ziusudra. The repulsive ones worship the fish-god Oannes, who struggles with Alvir and Valmir for control of the sea.

	<p>
		‘We must have that <b>golden net</b>, or the repulsive ones will use it against us. If you return it to us, we will reward you,’ says the high priest. ‘The Sunken City lies under the coastal waters off the Shadar Tor.’
