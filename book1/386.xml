		There is no sign of Lauria, but you do find an open trunk and a window with a knotted rope dangling from it. So, she found the treasure and then made her escape, leaving you behind to face the music. You allow yourself a tight-lipped smile as you hear her voice echoing leadenly from far off in the fog: ‘There’s a thief at Master Talanexor’s house! Quick!’
