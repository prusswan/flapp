		‘Fishing?’ you ask, ‘Surely nothing can live in these poisonous waters.’
	</p>
	<p>
		The fisherman shows you a bright yellow fish with grey stripes, saying, ‘Only the smoulder fish has adapted to the sulphur - it feeds on the local seaweed. Mind you the smoulder fish is totally inedible.’
	</p>
	<p>‘Why hunt it then?’</p>
	<p>
		‘Well, each fish is worth quite a bit to sorcerers and the like. We have a standing quota to fill each month for the magical colleges at Dweomer. The sulphur-laden organs burn in a particular way - a very useful ingredient in certain magics, I am told.’
	</p>
	<p>‘And where does all this sulphur come from?’</p>
	<p>
		‘Scholars say there is an underground volcanic vent. Others believe it is the breath of the sea dragon. Personally, I always drop a silver nugget into the waters once a month to appease the dragon, for his favourite metal is silver.’
