		You come round inside a disused warehouse, enmeshed in the net. You have been stripped of all your possessions - they are in a tidy pile nearby. Several men surround you. They are dressed in furs and robes that are adorned with hundreds of multicoloured feathers. Each man wears a necklace of animal skulls and has his teeth sharpened to needle-like points.
	</p>
	<p>
		‘Hallo,’ the leader says reasonably. ‘We are the Unspeakable Ones - it is our way to eat people in sacrifice of our god.’
	</p>
	<p>
		He points to a squat wooden idol of a grossly fat half-man, half ape with ivory needles for teeth. You notice the name ‘Badogor the Unspoken’ inscribed on a plaque at the base of the idol.
	</p>
	<p>‘Badogor the Unspoken - who’s he?’ you ask.</p>
	<p>
		‘Do not speak his name!’ shouts the cannibal, ‘Or you will be forever cursed!’
	</p>
	<p>
		You notice a large cauldron of boiling water into which another cultist is tossing herbs and garlic. He stares at you and licks his lips.
